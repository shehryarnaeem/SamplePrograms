LIMITATIONS IN ARRAYS:
Contiguous memory allocation.
Size has to be specified in the beginning.



ARRAYS VS LINKED LISTS:
For accessing, array uses constant time while a linked list uses linear time.
If the data is big then linked will consume lot less memory than array other than it depends on the strategy we are working on.
Insertion of an element in an array has a greater cost than inserting in a linked list.
